## What is this?

Just some empty(ish) files for quick prototyping. I use this to quickly test out ideas and concepts.

## Usage

### Simple HTML

Open the `simple/index.html` file in your browser and start editing.

Or use VSCode's live server extension to run the `index.html` file.

### Basic React

```
cd basic
npm install
npm run dev
```
